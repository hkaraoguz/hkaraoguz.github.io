title: About me
---

My name is Hakan Karaoguz. I am a machine learning expert with hands-on experience in several different fields such as classical machine learning, Computer Vision and NLP. I was involved in several end-to-end machine learning projects that started from the data gathering step and successfully deployed into production. My main goal is to develop production level machine learning solutions that will add value to business while being interpretable.
