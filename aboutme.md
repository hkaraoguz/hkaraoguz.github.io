title: About me
---

My name is Hakan Karaoguz. I am a machine learning expert with hands-on experience in several different fields such as classical machine learning, Computer Vision and NLP. I was involved in several end-to-end machine learning projects that started from the data gathering step and successfully deployed into production.

I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at [KnowIT Connectivity](https://www.knowit.se/tjanster/connectivity/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [RPL (CVAP)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439). I received my PhD degree from department of [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](http://www.ee.boun.edu.tr) [Boğaziçi University](http://www.boun.edu.tr) in 2015. During my PhD, I worked at
[Intelligent Systems Laboratory (ISL)](http://isl.ee.boun.edu.tr) under supervision of [Prof. Işıl Bozma](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/isil-bozma).

    ***PhD Thesis*** <br>
    *"Autonomous Multi-Robot Topological Spatial Cognition"*, <br>
    Supervisor: Prof. H. Işıl Bozma

    **Abstract**: Currently, multi-robot systems can only be used in limited environments. In order to integrate robots to daily life of humans, the robots should be able to understand and reason about the surrounding environment. In this thesis, a topological spatial cognition model that enables robots to reason about the environment and the spatial relations using both the robot’s own knowledge and knowledge obtained from other robots is developed. In addition, the proposed methods are implemented and tested in real-time using outdoor robots.
