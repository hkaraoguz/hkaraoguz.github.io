title: About me
---

My name is Hakan Karaoguz. I am a machine learning expert with hands-on experience in several different fields such as classical machine learning, Computer Vision and NLP. I was involved in several end-to-end machine learning projects that started from the data gathering step and successfully deployed into production.

I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at [KnowIT Connectivity](https://www.knowit.se/tjanster/connectivity/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [RPL (CVAP)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439). I received my PhD degree from department of [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](http://www.ee.boun.edu.tr) [Boğaziçi University](http://www.boun.edu.tr) in 2015. During my PhD, I worked at
[Intelligent Systems Laboratory (ISL)](http://isl.ee.boun.edu.tr) under supervision of [Prof. Işıl Bozma](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/isil-bozma).
